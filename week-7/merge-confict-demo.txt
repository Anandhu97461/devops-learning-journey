# This is a simulated merge conflict example

When Git cannot automatically merge changes between branches, it marks the file like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your current branch content
=======
Incoming branch content
>>>>>>> feature-branch

You need to manually edit, keep what you want, and delete the markers.
